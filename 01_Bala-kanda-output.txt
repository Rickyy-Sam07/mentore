RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	The king listened to the muni's words and then spoke: "I am not able to oppose that evil-souled asura.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	O Knower of the Law of Righteousness, I am but a wretched man and you are worthy of my worship; you are verily a god and also my spiritual preceptor.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	Since the gods, the danavas, gand-harvas, yakshas, birds and snakes cannot destroy Ravana, how can man do so?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	In battle, Ravana is able to defeat the mightiest warriors, it is certain therefore, that neither I nor my army can*ontend with him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	How can I then send my son, beautiful as a god, but inexperienced in war, to oppose Ravana?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	O Sage, I will not let my young child go.

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	Whoever you chooses, friends, relatives or even I myself will accompany you to engage in the fight."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	20_Dasarathas reluctance to allow Shri Rama to contend with Marica and Suvahu	On hearing the king's injudicious words, the holy sage was enraged.

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	21_Vishvamitra's request	"O King, you are born in the family of Ikshvaku and art righteousness personified!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	21_Vishvamitra's request	Blessed by fortune, filled with patience and endurance, you have cherished great vows and should'st not, therefore, abandon dharma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	21_Vishvamitra's request	The three worlds know you as virtuous, it is your duty to maintain integrity and not to act in contradiction to it.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	21_Vishvamitra's request	O Chief of Men, if one making a promise does not honour it, he loses the merit of his good deeds.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	21_Vishvamitra's request	It is, therefore, for you to be faithful to your word and let Rama accompany this sage.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	21_Vishvamitra's request	Though Shri Ramacandra is inexperienced in warfare, yet the asuras will not be able to overcome him.

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	He is as a god to us and our master, and we shall wed the husbands he chooses for us.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	"The wind god was enraged and entering their bodies, twisted and distorted them.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	Thus afflicted, the princesses in tears, approached their father for assistance.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	"The king was grieved to see his daughters in this condition and said:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	'O speak, what has occurred?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	Who, disregarding justice, has deformed you?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	Tell me all.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	32_Vishvamitra tells of his ancestors and the dynasty of King Kusha	The monarch was deeply moved by this event and his heart became heavy."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	When the hundred princesses were thus questioned by the king their father, they placed their heads at his feet and answered: "The wind god, who pervades all, has entered the evil path and desired us to forsake virtuous conduct.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	We told him we were not free to choose our way of life since our father was still living and that he should consult you if he wished to wed us, but that sinful god, disregarding our request has twisted and deformed our bodies in this manner."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	The great king hearing the complaint of the hundred virgins, said to them: "You have acted nobly by practising forbearance towards the deity.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	It is meet that the generous-minded should exercise forbearance, you have added to the honour of our dynasty.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Forbearance is the chief ornament of both man and woman, you have achieved something rare; few are capable of such forbearance.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	O Virgins, forbearance is charity, forbearance is truth, forbearance is sacrifice.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	A man's true glory is forbearance; forbearance is dharma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	The world is established in forbearance."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Having spoken thus, the princesses were comforted, and the king dismissed them.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Then the monarch, mighty like a god, summoned his ministers and consulted them regarding the alliance of his daughters to suitable families at the proper time and place.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Now a great muni named Chuli full of glory derived from prolonged celibacy and highly virtuous, was engaged in sacred austerities for the purpose of spiritual liberation.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	At that place, the virgin daughter of the nymph Urmila, named Somada, began to minister to the muni.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	She attended on the great sage for a long time with undeviating faith and devotion and her Guru was pleased with her; he said to her: "I am pleased with you, what desire of thine shall I fulfil?"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Perceiving the muni to be highly pleased, that sweet-voiced nymph acquainted with the art of conversation made answer to him: "O King of Kings, I desire to bear a son, resplendent with divine power, a worshipper of God and devoted to dharma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	I have no husband, nor do I wish to be the wife of any, as I am a brahmacarini, therefore, by virtue of your Yoga, grant me a son produced by the power of your thought."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	The divine Sage Chuli was pleased to hear these words and granted her a son named Brahmadatta, by the power of his mind.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Brahmadatta became King of Kampila and was as prosperous as Indra in heaven.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	King Kushanabha resolved to give his daughters in marriage to King Brahmadatta.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Kushanabha requested King Brahmadatta to visit him and joyfully gave him his daughters in marriage.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	O Ramaji, King Brahmadatta, who was equal to Indra in glory wedded the princesses one by one by taking their hands in his.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Through the touch of his hand, the princesses were freed from their deformity and restored to their former beauty.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	When King Kushnabha beheld his daughters released from their disfigurement and restored to their former beauty he was filled with joy.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Thus did the King Kushnabha give his daughters in marriage to King Brahmadatta and then commanded their preceptors to accompany them to the court of his son-in-law.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	33_King Kushanabha's hundred daughters	Somada was delighted with the union of her son to the damsels and receiving them with great affection, commended the virtuous King Kushanabha.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"O Ramaji, after the wedding of his daughters, the sinless King Kushanabha prepared to perform a sacrifice in order to obtain a son.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"At the inauguration of the sacrifice, the munificent King Kusha, son of Shri Brahma, said to Kushanabha:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	'O my Son, you will obtain a son like thyself, he should be named Gadhi, he will bring you immortal renown.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"After some time a son was born to the wise King Kushanabha who was a lover of virtue, and his name was Gadhi.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	This Gadhi, O Rama, was my virtuous father and because I was born in the family of Kusha I was called Kaushika.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"I had, O Prince, an elder sister named Satyavati, who became the faithful spouse of Richika.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	When her lord died, she ascended to heaven and took the form of the Kaushiki river.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	The river is sacred and beautiful, and its waters confer merit on men.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	To bless the world Satyavati became the river flowing near the Himalayas.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"O Prince, through love of my sister, I dwell on the banks of the Kaushiki river near the Himalayas.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"Established in truth, faithful to her lord, that sister of mine, named Satyavati is to-day the river Kaushiki, great among streams and highly fortunate.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"O Rama, in order to perform a sacrifice, I went to the Siddha ashrama, I have now accomplished my purpose.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"O Rama, at your instance, I have told you of my family and origin; the night is far spent in listening to this tale, now rest, so that, refreshed, we may resume our journey to-morrow.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	Peace be with you!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"The leaves of the trees are motionless, the birds and beasts are silent and darkness covers all.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	How imperceptibly the evening has passed away.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	The sky is brilliant with stars, as if a thousand eyes gazed down on us.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	"The bright moon with its cool beams, slowly rising higher and higher dispels the darkness.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	Nocturnal wanderers and the terrible flesh-eating yakshas prowl about here and there."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	Having uttered these words, the great Sage Vishvamitra became silent.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	The other munis praised him saying: "Well spoken, well spoken, O Sage."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	They said: "The dynasty of Kusha has ever practised righteousness and the kings of this line have been eminent in virtue.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	Of this dynasty, you, O Vishvamitra, art the most illustrious, the fame of this royal line has been enhanced by the beautiful river Kaushiki."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	Thus did the great sages praise the Rishi Vishvamitra, who then withdrew to rest, as the sun sets behind a mountain.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	34_Gadhi is the father of Vishvamitra	Shri Ramacandra and his brother Lakshmana, full of wonder also made obeisance to the holy sage and retired to sleep.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Having passed the night with the other munis on the banks of the river Shona, Shri Vishvamitra said to Prince Rama at daybreak: "Arise, O Prince, the day has dawned, may prosperity attend you!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Perform your morning devotions and let us prepare for our journey."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Shri Rama listened to the instructions of the holy sage, recited his morning prayers and prepared to leave, saying: "O Knower of God, the waters of the holy river Shona appear to be very shallow and rest on a sandy bed, be pleased to instruct us where we should cross over it."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	The sage replied: "O Prince, I will show you where the great rishis traversed it."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Thereafter they forded the river and journeyed on and on, enjoying the many beautiful woods and forests through which they passed.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	After proceeding a great distance, late one afternoon, they reached the holy river Ganges, beloved of the sages.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	On beholding the lovely river rendered beautiful by the presence of swans and cranes, Rama, Lakshmana and the sages were filled with delight.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	They halted on the banks and bathed in the sacred river as prescribed by the holy ordinance, then lighting their sacrificial fires they partook of the remains of the offerings.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	According to the tradition, they offered water to their ancestors and spreading coverings, seated themselves by the holy Ganges.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Sitting in the midst of the sages with the two princes before him, Shri Vishvamitra was questioned by Shri Rama in the following manner:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	"O Lord, I desire to hear the story of this holy river, which traverses the three paths.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	How does the sacred Gunga, passing through the three worlds merge at last in the ocean?"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	On this request, Shri Vishvamitra began to narrate the origin and genesis of the sacred river.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	"O Rama, the great Himavat, Lord of the Himalayas, the treasury of all precious metals, had two daughters, who were unsurpassed in loveliness on earth.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Their mother Mena, the wife of Himachala (Himavat) was the daughter of Mount Meru.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Her elder daughter was named Gunga and the younger Uma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	"The devas wishing to observe certain sacred rites, asked for Shri Gunga to promote the success of their undertaking and with the permission of her father, took her away with them.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	"Himachala, mindful of the good of all beings, gave his daughter Gunga, the purifier of the whole world, to the gods, thinking it to be his duty to do so.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	The gods supremely gratified took his daughter Gunga and blessing all, left Himachala.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	"O Prince of the House of Raghu, the other daughter of Himachala, named Uma, practised great asceticism, considering it to be her chief wealth.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	Himachala gave this ascetic daughter Uma, who was venerated by the whole world, to Shri Mahadeva in marriage, thinking him to be a worthy consort.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	"O Rama, now I have told you of the two daughters of Himachala, revered by the whole world, the river Gunga and Uma Devi.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	"O my Son, O Chief of Disciples, I have related to you the story of Shri Gunga accompanying the devas to heaven.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	35_Vishvamitra begins to narrate the origin of the holy river Ganga	This beautiful daughter of the King of Himalaya, once resident in heaven, is the charming river Gunga, whose waters destroy all sin."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	Hearing the wonderful narrative, so eloquently related by Shri Vishvamitra, both the princes praised the holy sage and said: "O Divine Sage, you have told us a tale, by the hearing of which great merit is acquired, be gracious enough to enlighten us further regarding the elder daughter of the King of Himalaya.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	You are omniscient, therefore describe to us fully, how the Gunga, the world purifying stream, came down from heaven to earth.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	O You, versed in the science of dharma, why is this sacred river called Tripathaga (the Traverser of the Three Worlds) and whence is this name derived?"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	Seated amidst the other sages, Shri Vishvamitra, whose only wealth was truth and austerity, spoke as follows, in answer to Shri Rama's questioning:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"O Prince, in ancient times, the holy Lord Mahadeva was wedded to Parvati and being charmed with her beauty devoted himself to the delights of connubial bliss.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	According to the measure of time of the gods, the Lord Mahadeva passed a hundred years with that devi but remained without issue.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	In their anxiety, the gods approached Shri Brahma and said:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"'Who will be able to endure the power and glory of the offspring produced by these two mighty beings?'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"They then took refuge with Shri Mahadeva, saying:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	'O God of Gods, O Mahadeva, ever engaged in doing good to all beings, we offer salutations to you, be gracious unto us!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	Your power, O First among the Gods, none can endure, therefore with this goddess engage in yogic penances.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	For the welfare of the three worlds, retain thine energy within your body so that the universe may be preserved and may not suffer destruction'."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	The Ruler of the World, Shri Mahadeva, listened to the words of the devas and said: "Be it so, O Devas, I will restrain my power so that all the regions including the earth may dwell in peace, but O Devas, should my vital fluid overflow, who shall receive it?"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	The gods answered Shri Mahadeva, saying: "Let the earth receive it."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	Then Shri Mahadeva let fall his seed on the earth covering the mountains, seas and forests.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	When the earth could bear no more, the devas asked the wind and fire deities to combine with that creative power and thus was a white mountain created and later a heavenly forest as resplendent as the light of the sun.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	From this fiery light was born the glorious Swami Karttikeya.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"All the gods and rishis were full of joy and adored the Lord Shiva and the goddess Uma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	As they worshipped them with grateful hearts, Uma was filled with wrath and said:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	'O Devas, your action has filled me with displeasure, you shall not escape the consequences.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"Then Uma shining like the sun, took water in the palm of her hand and pronounced a curse on the gods, saying:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	'O Devas, you have prevented me from bearing a son, may you be childless from this day, may your wives be without progeny.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"Still not appeased, Uma cursed the earth also and said:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	'O Earth, you shalt never remain in one form, you shalt have many masters.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	O Witless One, you shalt never bear a son, since you have prevented me from becoming a mother.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"Shri Mahadeva, seeing the devas discomfited, prepared to depart to the northern region of the Himalayas.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	There, on a peak named Himavatprabhava, he engaged in prolonged yogic practices together with Uma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	36_The story of the king of Himalayas' younger daughter Uma	"O Rama, I have told you of one of the two daughters of the Himalayas; now with Lakshmana, listen to the tale of the other daughter of Himalaya, named Gunga."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	Whilst Shri Mahadeva was engaged in yogic meditation, the devas, under the leadership of Agni, went to the region of Brahma where, with Indra, they paid reverence to the Lord of the world, and said: "O Lord, at the beginning of creation you did'st make Shri Mahadeva our leader, but he has now retired to the Himalayas and is engaged in the practice of austerity with Uma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	O You who art desirous of the good of the world, do what you considerest ought to be done, you are our only refuge."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	Then Shri Brahma encouraged the devas, with gentle words, saying: "O Devas, the curse of Uma Devi, that you should remain without offspring is irrevocable, but the fire god Agni will cause Ganga to bear a son who will destroy the enemies of the gods.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	The youngest daughter of Himancala (Uma) will look upon her sister's son as her own and will inevitably lavish her affection on him."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"O Rama, the words of Shri Brahma filled the gods with satisfaction and they offered obeisance to him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	Then they all circumambulated Mount Kailasha, the repository of precious metals, and begged Agni to beget a son.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"Agni acquiesced in their request and approaching Shri Ganga, said:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	'O Devi, let us beget a son for it is the wish of the gods.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"Assuming the form of a celestial nymph, Ganga, inspired the fire god to plant his seed in her, her every vein being filled with splendour.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	After a time, she addressed Agni, saying:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	'O Deva, I am unable to bear the ever-increasing splendour which you have communicated to me.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	My body is burning like fire, my mind is agitated and I am filled with fear.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"Agni replied:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	'O Sinless One, place this foetus near the Himalayas.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"Then Ganga Devi expelled the resplendent being, shining like gold.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	This substance, falling on the earth, became the purest gold that can be found.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	All objects in its proximity became silver and the more distant areas exposed to its penetrating rays became copper, the baser parts becoming zinc and lead.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	In this way, its brilliance was transmuted into metals and spread abroad and the mountains and forests near by were changed to gold.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	O Rama, gold being produced in that dazzling form is called jatarupa (form-bom) and, O Hero, that is why gold shines like fire.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	The grass, the creepers, the shrubs, all were converted into gold, and from that splendour was born Kumara.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"The devas with Indra engaged the Krittikas to nurse the child and they regarded him as their own son.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	The gods named the child Karttikeya and said:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	'He shall be our son and he will be renowned in the three worlds.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"The Krittikas bathed the child and as he grew, his form resembled the fire.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	Because the infant was born prematurely, the devas called him Skanda.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"The nurses began to nourish the child with milk and he shone like a flame.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	With six mouths he sucked the milk of six nurses at the same time.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	Soon he grew so powerful that while yet an infant he challenged groups of demons to combat.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	Then all the gods appointed him their commander-in-chief.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	The Devas and Agni paid affectionate homage to this child.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"O Rama, this is the inspiring and merit-bestowing story of Shri Ganga and Karttikeya.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	37_The king's elder daughter, Ganga	"O Raghava, on this earth, those who read this narrative with faith and devotion shall have long lives, sons and grandsons and obtain the divine region of Skanda."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	Shri Vishvamitra in gentle accents, related this story to Shri Ramacandra, and then again addressed him, saying:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	"In ancient times there lived a king named Sagara, who ruled in Ayodhya.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	He was brave and virtuous and a lover of his subjects, yet he was without issue.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	"The name of his chief queen was Keshini, a daughter of King Vidharba; she was virtuous and truthful.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	His second queen was Sumati, a daughter of Arishtanemi and she was comely and charming.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	"The king went to the Himalayas and engaged in severe yogic practices in the forest of Bhriguprasravana.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	When he had completed a hundred years' ascetic practices, the ever truthful Maharishi Bhrigu was pleased with hifn and favoured him with a boon.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	He said:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	'O Sinless King, you shalt beget many sons and your fame will be immeasurable.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	From one of your queens shall be born one son, and from the other sixty thousand sons.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	38_The story of King Sagara, Shri Rama's ancestor	"When the queens heard of the boon granted by the rishi, they approached him saying:

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Knowing you to have come, the other sages have sent a boat in preparation for crossing the holy river."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Shri Vishvamitra summoned the ferryman and with the princes and sages all were conveyed to the other side.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	They rested awhile on the opposite bank and entertained the sages in their company.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	In the distance, they saw the city named Vishala and soon the great Rishi Vishvamitra with the princes reached that place of beauty, which resembled one of Indra's cities.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Then Rama, full of wisdom, approached the holy sage and humbly made enquiry concerning the city.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	He said: "O Great Sage, what royal and illustrious house rules here?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	I desire to hear."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	At these words of Rama, the holy sage began to relate the story of the city as follows:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"O Rama, attend!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	I will tell you the story of this city, which I heard from Indra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"In the golden age (Satya Yuga) Diti gave birth to a powerful son Daitya, an asura, and Aditi gave birth to the highly fortunate and exceedingly righteous son Devata, a celestial being.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	These two sagacious beings sought to become immortal, incorruptible and free from disease, old age and other ills.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	After reflecting on this matter, they resolved to chum Kshiroda (the ocean of milk) and obtain from it the water of immortality.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Using the mighty snake Vasuki as a rope and the Mandara mountain as the churn, they began to churn the ocean.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	When they had done so for a thousand years, the snake Vasuki bit the rocks with its teeth and threw up venom.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	From this was produced the great poison which began to consume men, gods, demons and the whole world.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"The gods took refuge with the Lord Shiva and worshipped him crying 'Protect us, protect us'.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Attracted by the mournful cry of the gods, Shri Mahadeva and Shri Hari appeared there with conch and disc.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"Shri Vishnu smilingly addressed the bearer of the trident, Shri Mahadeva, and said: 'O Lord, you are the chief of the gods and should'st, therefore, accept whatever is first produced by the churning of the ocean.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Receive the poison as your gift, the first tribute.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"Having spoken thus, Shri Vishnu disappeared, and the Blessed Lord Shiva, moved by the distress of the gods and the words of Shri Vishnu, drank the dreadful poison, as if it were nectar, and returned to Kailasha.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"O Prince of Raghu, the devas and the daityas began churning once more, but the churning staff began to sink.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Then the devas and gandharvas praised the Lord Vishnu, saying:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	'O Blessed Lord, You are the Master of all beings, you are the asylum of the gods--protect us all, O Great Lord, and support the sinking Mandara mountain'.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"Shri Vishnu, assuming the form of a tortoise, entered the ocean and supported the mountain on his back.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Taking hold of the peak in his hand, the blessed Vishnu churned the ocean, standing between the devas and the asuras.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"After a thousand years, Shri Dhanvantari, the teacher of the Ayur Veda appeared, holding a staff and loshta in his hands; thereafter many nymphs emerged.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	O Raghava, they were called apsaras, 'ap' meaning water and 'yara' to 'emerge from'; on this account these beautiful damsels were named 'apsaras'.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	O Rama, they numbered six hundred million and their female attendants were innumerable.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	None were received either by the devas or the daityas, hence they remained without a lord.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"Then, O Prince, Varuni, the daughter of the god Varuna was born.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	The sons of Aditi did not accept her, but the asuras gladly did so.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Those who rejected her were called suras (devas) and those who received her became merry and were called asuras.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"O Raghava, then the celestial horse Uccaihshravas and the jewel Kaustubha also rose out of the sea, and they were succeeded by the water of immortality.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"O Rama, the devas fought with the danavas for possession of the nectar and the daityas allied themselves with the asuras in this struggle; terrible indeed was this combat.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"After many had lost their lives in the fight, Shri Vishnu assumed the form of Mohini, a charming woman the product of Maya and stole the nectar from the combatants.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	"Those who opposed the imperishable Vishnu were destroyed by him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	In this conflict the gods slew countless daityas.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	45_The city of Vishala and the churning of the ocean	Indra, after slaying the asuras, became the king of the devas and with the help of the sages began to rule with joy."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	"O Rama, learning that her children had been slain, Diti was much afflicted and approached her husband Kasyapa with the words:

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	I desire a son who will be able to destroy Indra, though to this end I must undergo great penance.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	Such austerities I will perform, if you will grant me a son that is mighty, valorous, strong-willed and firm of purpose.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'"The holy sage answered the afflicted Diti saying:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	''Be it so!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	Remain chaste for a thousand years, you shalt then bear a son capable of destroying Indra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	By my grace, your child shall be the ruler of the three worlds.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'"Thus did the sage console Diti, and blessing her, departed to practise penance.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	Diti retired contentedly to the forest of Kushaplava and began to undergo severe austerities.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'"Indra then, coming there, paid reverence to her and began to serve her with humility, supplying her with fire, kusha grass and other necessities, massaging her body when she became weak from the severity of ascetic practices.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	O Rama, Indra served Diti for a thousand years less ten days.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'"Then Diti joyfully addressed Indra saying:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	''O Indra, your father has promised to grant me a son after a thousand years penance.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	You shalt soon behold your brother, whom I desire shall overcome you.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	With him you shalt share the three worlds and be happy, have no anxiety.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'"By this time the afternoon had come.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	Diti overcome with sleep, placing her feet where her head had lain, carelessly assumed an impure posture.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'"Indra rejoiced and laughed aloud.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	Entering her body, he cut the foetus into seven pieces with his great mace.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	Diti's slumber was interrupted by the cry of the child in her womb.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'Indra said to it 'Do not weep', 'Do not weep', and again divided the child with his mace, despite Diti's cries, 'Do not destroy it, do not destroy it'.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	'"Then Indra paused in his murderous assault and with extreme humility addressed Diti saying
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	''O Did, you wast impure through sleeping with your feet towards the head of the couch, you did'st thus occupy an improper posture.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	46_Diti undergoes severe austerities for the birth of a son	I have, therefore, severed thine unborn child into seven parts, since he was to be the cause of my destruction.

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	Knowing the foetus to be divided into seven parts, Diti was greatly perturbed and said to Indra:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	"Through my fault has this come to pass; O Indra, you are in no wise guilty.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	This child being divided, for your good and mine own, I declare that these seven shall become the protectors of the forty-nine winds.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	These seven sons of divine appearance shall be known as the Bala-kanda winds.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	Let one wander about in the region of Brahma, another in the region of Indra, and the third in space.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	Let the remaining four winds go anywhere under your instructions; may they all be known by the name of Maruts, conferred on them by you."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	With joined palms, the thousand-eyed god Indra said in reply to Diti: "O Devi, it will assuredly come to pass as you desires.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	Your sons shall wander about in the form of devas in the Tapovana forest."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	Thus reconciled and fully satisfied the mother and son ascended to heaven.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	Thus have I heard, O Rama!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	This is that Tapovana forest in which Indra formerly served his mother Diti.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	O Lion among Men, here a great city was founded by the righteous Prince Vishala, the son of King Ikswaku and Alambusa.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	O Rama, the mighty son of Vishala was named Hemacandra, and his son was the renowned Sucandra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	O Rama, the son of Sucandra was Dhumrashva and his son was Srinjaya.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	The glorious Sahadeva was the son of Srinjaya and the son of Sahadeva was the highly virtuous Krishashva.

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	The king said: "O Muni, to-day I am indeed fortunate that you have been gracious enough to visit my kingdom.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	47_The holy sage and the princes arrive at Vishala and are welcomed by King Pramati	None is more blessed than I."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	King Pramati having enquired as to the well-being of Shri Vishvamitra, said:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"O Holy Sage, may the Lord protect those two youths; be gracious enough to tell me who they may be.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	These princes, equal to the gods in power, walking with the gait of an elephant, fearless as lions or bulls in combat, whose eyes resemble lotuses, who are armed with swords, bows and quivers, who rival the heavenly Asvins in beauty and who, in the flower of their youth, appear like gods, visiting the earth.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Why are they travelling on foot?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Whose sons are they?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Why are they come?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Enhancing the earth as the sun and moon illumine the sky; their manner of address and bearing showing them to be kinsmen, why are these two heroes of high descent, bearing mighty weapons, found on this hard path?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	I long to hear."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Shri Vishvamitra related to the king the whole story of the visit to the Siddha Ashrama and the slaying of the asuras.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	The king was highly gratified to meet the princes, and perceiving them to be virtuous, entertained them with the greatest respect.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Shri Ramacandra and Lakshmana having received hospitality from King Pramati, passed the night there.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	The following day they left for Mithilapuri, the capital of King Janaka.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	When they beheld the city at a distance, they cried out: "How beautiful, how beautiful it is!"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Thereafter, finding a charming hermitage which was uninhabited, Rama enquired of the Rishi Vishvamitra as follows: "O Sage, how can it be that this beautiful hermitage is unfrequented?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	O Lord, tell us whose has been this hermitage?"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Shri Vishvamitra, chief among the eloquent, answered Rama, saying: "O Prince, hear the true story of this hermitage, I will relate to you who was its author and how he cursed it in anger.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"O Rama, this place, a source of wonder even to the gods, belonged to the Rishi Gautama and resembled the abode of the celestials.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Here with Ahalya, the sage practised Yoga for thousands of years.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"O Rama, one day, the sage having gone to a distant place, Indra, finding Ahalya alone, assumed his form, and said to her:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	'O Fair One, I am overcome by desire, let us carry out our conjugal duty.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"O Raghava, though Ahalya recognized Indra disguised as her lord, yet she acceded to his request.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Then Ahalya addressed Indra saying:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	'O Indra, I am highly gratified, now depart quickly, unobserved.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	O Chief of the gods, preserve me and thyself from Gautama.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"Indra laughed and answered:
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	'O You of beautiful waist, to-day I rejoice, I will now depart for my own region.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	On this, he sought to leave the hut of Ahalya.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"O Rama, at that instant he observed the Rishi Gautama entering the hut and he became agitated and anxious.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Seeing the holy sage unconquered by devas or danavas, endowed with the power of Yoga, drenched with holy water, shining like fire, holding the sacred fuel and kusha grass in his hands, Indra was terrified and grew pale.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"Shri Gautama perceiving Indra in his own guise and judging by his guilty looks that he was leaving his spouse having committed sin with her, cursed him saying:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	"'O Wicked Wretch, assuming my form, you have committed this sinful act.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Be you impotent.'
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Cursed by the Rishi Gautama, Indra was instantly deprived of his manhood.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	48_Gautama's hermitage	Then the Sage Gautama cursed Ahalya also saying:

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	50_The place of sacrifice by King Janaka	The king received all with a cheerful countenance and with joined palms said to Shri Vishvamitra: "O August Lord, please be seated with the other great sages."

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	51_Gautama's son Shatananda	O Holy Sage, please tell me; when my tranquil-minded sire entered the hermitage, was he honoured by Shri Rama?"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	51_Gautama's son Shatananda	Shri Vishvamitra, skilled in the art of converse and acquainted with the laws of rhetoric, answered Shri Shatananda saying:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	51_Gautama's son Shatananda	"O Great Muni, I did that which should be done, by speaking that which was proper to the occasion, and patiently listening to that which was spoken, recollecting my duty.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	51_Gautama's son Shatananda	As Jamadagni, who first cursed Renuka and was then reconciled to her, so has your father shown favour to your mother and received her again."

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	'The sages hearing the words of Vishvamitra and being acquainted with the tradition, consulted together saying: "The son of Kaushika, the Rishi Vishvamitra, is given to wrath.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	If we do not fulfil his desire, like a consuming fire he will pour out his curse upon us.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	Let us, therefore, assist him in the sacrifice so that the king may enter heaven in his physical body.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	Now let us inaugurate the rites."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	'Then the rites began, as prescribed by ancient tradition, Vishvamitra acting as the chief priest and the learned brahmins becoming the sacrificing priests subordinate to him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	Observing numerous rituals, the sacrifice continued for a long time.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	Then Shri Vishvamitra called thither the gods for their share of the sacrifice, but none of these celestial beings appeared.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	At this the great sage grew exceedingly wroth and lifting up the sacrificial vessel, said to the King Trishanku: "O King, behold the power of my asceticism by virtue of which I now send you to heaven in your embodied state.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	60_King Trishanku ascends to a specially created heaven	O King, though it is deemed impossible to accomplish this, by the power acquired by me I now say to you; 'ascend to heaven in your physical form.'"

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	Meanwhile, King Ambarisha of Ayodhya inaugurated the horse sacrifice, but the horse was carried away by Indra, on which the priest addressed the monarch, saying: "O King, it is for you to protect the sacrificial steed, the horse has been stolen away owing to your negligence, therefore, provide another or seek a human victim, so that the sacrifice may be accomplished without further hindrance."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	Hearing these words, the renowned monarch offered thousands of cows to whosoever should find either a horse, or human being.

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	After searching many countries, I have not found either a horse or a human victim for the sacrifice.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	O Lord, do you, therefore, deliver your son to me and accede to my request."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	Richika answered: "O King, I will never bestow my eldest son on any."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	His wife then said: "My Lord does not wish to part with the eldest son, but the youngest son Shunaka is dearest to me, I shall not part with him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	O Great Muni, the eldest son is beloved of his father and the youngest is dear to his mother, therefore, these two should not be taken away."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	61_King Ambarisha's sacrificial horse is lost	O Rama, the middle son, whose name was Shunashepha, hearing these words, spoke thus: "My father does not wish to part with his eldest son, nor my mother with her youngest, therefore, take me, O King."

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	While the king rested, Shunashepha, going to a certain spot, beheld Shri Vishvamitra, his maternal uncle, engaged with other sages in the performance of spiritual practices and he, sorrowful, thirsty and fatigued, fell at the feet of the sage, and said: "O Lord, for me there is neither father, mother, relative nor caste.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	O Peaceful Sage, O Sovereign among ascetics, I take refuge in you; in the name of dharma, deliver me.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	You can'st protect the whole world, how much more one so insignificant as myself.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	Do you assist the king in the completion of his sacrifice that it may be accomplished without hindrance, and may I live and by means of my spiritual practices obtain heaven.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	You are my master who am masterless.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	Protect me, wretched as I am, as a father protects his child."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'Shri Vishvamitra, hearing the piteous words of Shunashepha addressed his own sons, saying: "O My Sons, that world for which fathers beget their children is at hand, this child is the son of the Sage Richika and has taken refuge in me, let us protect his life.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	You are all virtuous and charitable, let one of you take the place of the sacrificial victim at the king's sacrifice, and thus satisfy the God Agni.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	In this way, we can rescue Shunashepha.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	Assist me in the completion of the king's sacrifice, propitiate the gods, and enable me to be true to my word."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'Hearing these words, Madhusyanda and the other sons sullenly replied to Vishvamitra, saying: "O King of Kings, would'st you abandon thine own sons and protect another's?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	Such an action resembles the relinquishing of a tasty dish to partake of the flesh of a dog."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'Hearing this reply, Shri Vishvamitra grew angry and, his eyes inflamed with wrath, he said: "Your speech is arrogant and contrary to dharma, it is a violation of filial affection.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	I regard you all as insubordinate, therefore, I now curse you.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	Like the sons of Shri Vasishtha, may you fall from your high caste and, eating the flesh of dogs, wander about in the world during the period of a thousand years!"
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'Having thus cursed his sons, the muni, offering Shunashepha his protection, thus instructed him: "O Son of a Sage, at King Ambarisha's sacrifice, allow thyself to be bound, adorned with the red garland, besmeared with sandalwood paste and tied to the sacrificial post.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	I will impart to you two mantrams, which when repeated, will deliver you."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'The holy sage then carefully instructed him in the sacred formulas.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	Thereafter, Shunashepha approached the king and said: "O Illustrious Monarch, now enter upon the initiation without delay and accomplish the performance of your sacrifice."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'The king, filled with joy, went without delay to the sacrificial pavilion.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	With the consent of the officiating priest, the king now dressed Shunashepha in red attire and tied him to the post as the consecrated victim.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	Being bound, Shunashepha began to praise Upendra by reciting the mantrams he had been given by Vishvamitra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'Indra, pleased with the worship of Shunashepha, bestowed the blessing of long life on him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'O Rama, then did the king complete his sacrifice and obtain the desired fruit from Indra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	62_Shunashepha obtains help from Vishvamitra	'Thereafter, the righteous Vishvamitra renewed his yogic penance in Pushkara and performed it there for a thousand years.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Shri Vishvamitra passed a thousand years in the practice of mortification, then the gods came to bestow on him the fruits of his asceticism.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	The supreme Brahma addressed him in pleasing accents, saying: "O Holy One, mayest you be prosperous, you are now become a rishi by virtue of your great austerities."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Having said this, Shri Brahma and the other celestial beings returned to their own spheres.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Vishvamitra again engaged in severe austerity and in this way passed many more years.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	While thus employed, the celestial nymph Menaka came to bathe in the Pushkara lake.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Resembling lightning illumining a cloud, her beauty stirred the passion of Vishvamitra and he said to her:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	"Be gracious to me for I am filled with a great love for you."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Then that beautiful one agreed to take up her abode in the hermitage of the rishi'.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	The penances of Vishvamitra were thus rendered void by the presence of Menaka in the hermitage.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	O Rama, that nymph passed ten years in that place.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	After this time, Shri Vishvamitra perceiving himself to have been deluded, was filled with shame and he reflected on the cause of his infatuation.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Then he adjudged the gods to have devised this plan to bring his ascetism to nought and he cried out: "What, have I passed ten years with this woman, as it were a night.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Alas!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	My great austerities are destroyed by this passion."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Sighing heavily and filled with remorse, he beheld Menaka trembling with fear, standing near, but Vishvamitra addressing her in reassuring words, bade her farewell.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Having controlled his passions, Shri Vishvamitra went to the northern mountains and began to perform penance in the Himalayas on the bank of the Kaushiki river.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Then, O Rama, the gods were filled with fear by the austerities practised by the rishi on the Himalayan mountains, and approaching Shri Brahma said:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	"O Grandsire, now grant the title of maharishi to Shri Vishvamitra."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Shri Brahma then appeared before Vishvamitra and in gentle accents said to him: "Hail to You, O Rishi, I am pleased with thine austerity.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	I name you chief among the rishis."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Then Vishvamitra, making obeisance to Shri Brahma, spoke submissively saying: "O Lord, these penances have been undertaken by me that I might become a brahmarishi.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Since you still namest me maharishi, I regard myself as not yet fully self-subdued."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Shri Brahma answered, saying: "So it is, you have not yet fully gained the mastery over your senses.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	O Great Muni, undergo further penance."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Having uttered these words, Shri Brahma returned to the celestial regions.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Then Vishvamitra began an exceedingly severe penance, standing unsupported with his arms raised, living only on air; in the summer season, standing in the midst of five fires, in the rainy season lying without a canopy, in the winter practising his spiritual discipline in water, thus did he pass a thousand years.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	Perceiving Vishvamitra undergoing these severe penances, the gods were greatly perturbed.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	63_Vishvamitra is proclaimed a Maharishi	At length their lord, Indra, approached the nymph Rambha and begged her to promote his interest and cause harm to Vishvamitra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Indra thus addressed Rambha saying: "O Rambha, it is for you to accomplish this great work and stimulate the passions of the great Sage Vishvamitra, so that his spiritual practices may be rendered void."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	O Rama, Rambha, filled with apprehension on hearing the words of Indra, said in humility: "O Indra, the Rishi Vishvamitra is easily moved to wrath, he will certainly curse me if I approach him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	I fear to enter his presence, do not therefore ask me to undertake this task."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	To Rambha, trembling with fear, standing with joined palms, in token of submission, Indra made answer: "O Rambha, fear not, accomplish my desire, may success attend you!
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	In the spring season, assuming the form of a cuckoo calling sweetly, accompanied by the god of love, I will take my place on a blossoming tree not far from you.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	O Rambha, attired in beautiful and charming apparel do you divert the mind of the muni from his spiritual practices."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	At the instance of Indra, that lovely nymph clad in enchanting raiment, faintly smiling, went forth to allure the heart of Shri Vishvamitra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	At that moment, the liquid notes of the cuckoo began to delight the rishi and he then beheld the nymph Rambha.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Stirred by the cuckoo's note and the ravishing sound of the beautiful Rambha's song, Shri Vishvamitra, recollecting his former fall, was filled with misgiving and recognizing the design of the god Indra, transported with rage, cursed Rambha, saying:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	"O Rambha, O Unfortunate One, you have come hither to lure me from my penance, I, who have conquered lust and anger.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Mayest you become petrified and take the form of a rock for ten thousand years.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	A brahmin perfected in the power of Yoga shall one day deliver you from this curse."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Having pronounced this curse on Rambha, the rishi became a prey to remorse, for, giving way to wrath he lost the fruit of all his yogic practices.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Rambha having been instantly turned to stone, Indra and Kama, perceiving the sage filled with wrath, fled in terror.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Shri Vishvamitra having lost the merit of his penances could obtain no peace; his passions remaining unsubdued, he resolved to speak no word to any and never give way to anger; he said: "For a thousand years, I will not breathe.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Reducing my body to the last extremity, mastering my senses, I will obtain brahmanhood by the power of my penance.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	Measureless years, shall I remain standing, neither breathing nor eating, even should my limbs become atrophied."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	64_Indra sends Rambha	O Rama, Vishvamitra resolved to perform this mortification for the space of a thousand years.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	After this the great Rishi Vishvamitra, leaving the northern quarter, went eastward and engaged in a most severe course of austerities.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	Observing silence for a thousand years, he performed incomparable ascetic practices, hardly able to be accomplished.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	After a thousand years, his form reduced to the semblance of wood, the royal sage, under the greatest provocation, was not incited to anger.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	O Rama, when Vishvamitra was persuaded that he had conquered anger, his vow of a thousand years' mortification being terminated, he sat down to eat.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	At that time, Indra appeared in the guise of a brahmin and requested the food set before the muni, upon which Vishvamitra, believing him to be a sage, gave him the whole which he had prepared for himself and still observing the vow of silence, uttered no word.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	' The chief of the sages, suspending his breath for a further thousand years, continued his penance, then there issued from his head a smoke which terrified the beings of the three worlds.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	By the power of his mortification, the devas, gandharvas, and other beings were deprived of their glory and lost consciousness.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	In distress, they addressed Shri Brahma saying: "O Lord, by every means in our power, we have sought to distract the great sage from his penances and provoke him to anger, but he has persisted in his practices and is free from desire and aversion.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	If you dost not grant him brahmanhood, verily the three worlds will be destroyed.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	None can find rest anywhere, the seas are drying up and the mountains are riven by the power of his austerities; the sun is deprived of its splendour, the earth is agitated and the wind stirs not.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	O Lord, we cannot move him from his resolve.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	On account of this peril, men like atheists have given up the performance of charitable deeds.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	Nowhere is peace to be found.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	O Divine Being, lest the mighty Vishvamitra, resplendent as fire, determine to destroy the universe, deign to grant him his desire.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	As Time, in the form of fire, at the dissolution of the world, consumes the whole universe, so also will the Sage Vishvamitra.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	Grant him, therefore, Indrahood, if he so desire it, for if You withhold brahmanhood which he has sought to acquire, then only the sovereignty of Indra's region, will content him."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	Thus approached, Shri Brahma, accompanied by the gods, appeared before Shri Vishvamitra and in pleasing accents addressed him, saying: "O Brahmarishi, reverence to you, we are pleased with thine austerity.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	O Holy Vishvamitra, by the power of your penance, you have acquired brahmanhood.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	The gods bless you, may prosperity attend you, may longevity be thine I From to-day, you are free, now go where you pleases."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	Offering salutations to Shri Brahma and all the gods, Shri Vishvamitra said: "Having bestowed brahmanhood and longevity upon me, grant me instruction in the holy syllable 'aum' and the Vedas also, and further invest me with the authority to officiate at the sacrifice.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	O You Gods, let the son of Brahma, Shri Vasishtha, fully acquainted with the Vedic science, acknowledge me as a brahmarishi.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	If this desire of mine be fulfilled, you may all depart."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	Thereupon the gods appeared before Shri Vasishtha, who having acquiesced in their wish and sealed his friendship with Vishvamitra, said to him: "Verily you are now a brahmarishi and as such I acknowledge you."

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	Thus did the illustrious Sage Vishvamitra acquire brahmanhood.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	65_Vishvamitra performs another thousand years' austerities	The divine sage then paid homage to the great Vasishtha and, his purpose accomplished, wandered about the earth engaged in charitable deeds.

RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	I have also been acquainted with your heroic deed, the breaking of the bow at Janakapura, verily a feat exciting wonder and surpassing imagination.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Having heard of thine achievement, I, taking this other bow, have come hither.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	With this terrible bow named Yamadagni, show your strength, O Rama, and placing an arrow in it, discharge it.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Should'st you be able to accomplish this, I will engage in honourable combat with you."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Hearing these words, King Dasaratha, became dejected and humbly addressed the rishi, saying: "O Holy Parasurama, you are a great brahmin sage, it becomes you not to show anger to warriors; be gracious unto my son, who is still a child.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	You are born in the family of Bhrigu and hast pledged thyself to Indra to bear arms no more.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Having given the dominion of the world to Kashyapa and retired to the Mahendra mountain to practise asceticism, why hast you now come hither to destroy us?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	O Sage, if Rama is slain, none of us will survive."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	The great son of Jamadagni, disregarding the entreaty of King Dasaratha, again addressed Rama, saying: "O Rama, these two bows of exquisite design, famed throughout the world, exceedingly powerful, were forged by Vishvakarma.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	One of them, wielded by Shri Shiva in combat with Tripura, was broken by you.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	The other, held by me, of inexpressible power, was given to Vishnu by the gods and is known to give victory over the foe; it is equal in moment to that which you have broken.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	"Formerly the gods asked Brahma which of the two excelled the other and Shri Brahma, acquainted with their intention, invoked a quarrel between Vishnu and Mahadeva.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	They entered into combat one with the other.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	By the shout raised by Shri Vishnu, Shri Mahadeva was struck motionless and his bow unstrung.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Then the gods and rishis came to that place and caused the two gods to be reconciled.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Thereafter the gods esteemed the bow of Vishnu to be the more powerful and Shri Shiva surrendered his bow to the King of Mithila, together with all its arrows.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	"This bow, belonging to Vishnu, was given in ancient times by that god to Richika and he gave it to his son Jamadagni, my father.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	He having renounced the bearing of weapons, retired to practise austerity, when the rash and foolish monarch Sahasravaku slew him.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Hearing of the cruel death of my sire, I successively destroyed the warrior caste, from generation to generation, thus acquiring dominion over the earth.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	I conferred this great dominion as a gift on the Sage Kashyapa at the completion of a sacrifice, and retired to the Mahendra mountain, cheerfully observing the practice of Yoga.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	To-day, O Valiant Prince, acquainted with your great achievement, I have come hither to behold you.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	Receive this bow, bestowed on my ancestors by Shri Vishnu and in the spirit of a warrior, place an arrow on it.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	75_Parasurama challenges Rama to combat	If you succeed in drawing the bow, I will challenge you to fight."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	Hearing these words, Shri Rama having regard for the presence of his sire, answered with restraint, saying: "O Parasurama, your deeds are known to me, as also the avenging of your fathers' murderers.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	Methinks you dost deem me lacking in valour, I, a kshatriya, and a descendant of the Solar race.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	O Rishi, witness my prowess."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	Having spoken thus, Shri Ramacandra, incensed, seized the bow and arrows from the rishi's hands and stringing it, placed an arrow on it.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	While drawing the mighty bow, the son of Dasaratha addressed the rishi with defiance, saying: "O Sage, you are a brahmin and as such do I honour you; you are further a kinsman of Shri Vishvamitra, therefore I shall not slay you with this arrow, but by this shaft I will rob you of the power of motion so that you shall no longer be able to travel through space, or I will banish you from those high regions to which you have attained by the practice of penance.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	Say, what is your desire?
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	This divine arrow of Vishnu, possessing the power of vanquishing the strength and pride of the foe, may not be restored by me to the quiver, till it has accomplished its great purpose."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	When Rama placed the arrow in the sacred bow, Brahma, with the gods, assembled to behold that glorious deed, followed by the gandharvas, apsaras, yakshas and other beings.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	Shri Ramacandra, having taken up the mighty bow, the three worlds began to tremble and Parasurama, bereft of his divine power, stood aghast.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	Deprived of his glory and powerless, Shri Parasurama with humble entreaty, addressed the lotus-eyed Rama:--
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	"When the dominion of the earth was given by me to the sage Kashyapa, he said 'You must not inhabit this kingdom Therefore, O Rama, in obedience to the sage, I do not stay on the earth by night.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	This world is no longer mine, but belongs to Kashyapa.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	O Rama, do not deprive me of the power of movement, but allow me speedily to return to the beautiful Mahendra mountain.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	You can'st deprive me of the merits earned by the practice of Yoga.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	I know You to be the Imperishable, You are verily Vishnu Himself, none but You could'st wield this bow.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	O Son of Raghu, the gods have assembled to behold You; You are pre-eminent in combat, and the conqueror of Thine enemies.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	O Virtuous Prince, to be defeated by You is no ignominy; discharge Your matchless arrow and I will return to the Mahendra mountain."
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	Thereupon Shri Ramacandra discharged the arrow and the merit of Parasurama was rendered void, whereupon he speedily departed to the Mahendra mountain.
RAMA	01_Bala-kanda	76_Parasurama is vanquished and deprived of his glory and power	The darkness being dispelled and the whole world once more filled with light, Rama was worshipped by the gods and rishis, and Shri Parasurama having circumambulated the son of Dasaratha, returned to his own hermitage.
